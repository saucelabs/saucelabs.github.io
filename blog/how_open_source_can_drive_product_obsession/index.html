<a href=https://twitter.com/bromann class=text-primary>Christian Bromann</a></p><div class=content><p>Nearly every start-up company goes through the same experience - the founders
will start with a vision or idea that pivots over time as the product (hopefully)
finds its market fit and is modified and adapted to the needs and requests of end
users. While there are some cases where the concept initially presented in the
pitch deck is the same product five years later, these are the exception, not the
rule. Given that modern software technologies evolve quickly and require
ever-evolving product adaptations, Software as a Service (SaaS) companies are
particularly prone to this need for change.</p><p>When I joined Sauce Labs in 2014 I found myself in a typical Silicon Valley
start-up - it was an engineering-driven company with a single large office for
70 employees located in the heart of SOMA, San Francisco. Since then, the company
has grown to 300 employees with multiple offices around the globe. These
operational changes have been accompanied by various cultural changes as new
employees have joined the company. This can be challenging for engineering
organizations as they work to maintain their focus on a technical product.</p><p>As the Sauce customer base expanded, so did the list of technical requirements.
We needed to grow beyond offering browsers in the cloud for automated Selenium
tests. The build out of the product roadmap required extensive hiring and
re-organization. What had been a single engineering team working on a specific
feature was now a dispersed, diverse group of people with different
responsibilities including engineers, scrum masters, product management,
sales engineering, product marketing, and more.</p><figure class="img-responsive text-center my-5"><a href=https://unsplash.com/@anniespratt target=_blank><img src=/images/blog/how-open-source-can-drive-product-obsession/how_open_source_can_drive_product_obsession_1.jpg></a><figcaption><p>Photo by Annie Spratt (Unsplash)</p></figcaption></figure><p>Delegating certain product responsibilities to others allowed engineers to
focus on their work, implementing new features and fixing bugs. This model
can work for non-technical consumer products but can be problematic when
building a product that is targeted to developers and other technical users.
Problems arise as engineers become decoupled from the users of their product,
and feedback loops go through multiple channels that are often narrated by a
non-technical person. Product obsession can sometimes be lost in the shuffle
when addressing existing customer requirements.</p><p>When engineers are not exposed to or engaged with customers, they lose the
personal connection to the product as they don’t experience the excitement
a customer shares if the product works well nor the frustration if it doesn’t.
Often the desire to solve technical challenges gets prioritized over the
actual usefulness to the end user. A relationship to the product has to be
developed internally as well as externally otherwise features just appear
to be boxes of value being thrown over an imaginary wall.</p><figure class="img-responsive text-center my-5"><a href=https://www.slideshare.net/ManueldelaPeaPea/testing-101-66597895 target=_blank><img src=/images/blog/how-open-source-can-drive-product-obsession/how_open_source_can_drive_product_obsession_2.jpg></a><figcaption><p>Modified picture of a sauceio.com blog post (see slide 24 of <a href=https://www.slideshare.net/ManueldelaPeaPea/testing-101-66597895>https://www.slideshare.net/ManueldelaPeaPea/testing-101-66597895</a>)</p></figcaption></figure><p>While it is the responsibility of a product owner to build out the product
vision, innovation can’t be driven by a product team alone. It needs support
from an engineering perspective especially if the product is targeted to
developers. Dogfooding is a very well known technique that can build such a
product obsessed culture. A developer being passionate about his own product
is a key ingredient for the healthy development of a technical vision and
direct customer engagement plays an important role here as it helps engineers
to identify themselves with what the company sells at the end of the day.</p><p>As an open source enthusiast and maintainer of various OSS projects I have always
enjoyed connecting directly with customers on a daily basis. It has been the
source of many ideas, some of which have become offerings on the Sauce Labs
platform. This cycle of speaking to customers, feeling their pain, finding a
solution, and building a product to solve it, has proven to be a simple but
successful way to build up my own product obsession. We opened the Open Source
Program Office at Sauce Labs anticipating that we can drive our product
obsession on an organizational level even further. Moreover open source
initiatives often provide additional strategic and operational advantages.
When we support various OSS frameworks by improving their integration with
Sauce Labs we increase the likelihood that users will run their tests with
these frameworks on our platform, enjoying the best possible experience.
This also helps us to connect with project communities, build up relationships
and attract talent to join our company mission. Most importantly, by
providing our developers with clear open source project policies and guidelines
we can help them establish a better connection with their project, a key
driver to increasing product obsession and their relationship to the customer.</p><p>Open source should be considered as part of every product roadmap and open
source contributions included as essential deliverables of every product.
This can only work if there are clear guidelines and policies that reflect
the companies values of good open source software. The program office should
not act as gatekeeper here and rather try to support every team it needs to.
It is important that members of the office are involved in product and roadmap
discussions to inform the team of important developments in the ecosystem as
well as advise on product deliverables that supports building and growing our
own ecosystem. For example, every public-facing API must be delivered with a
programmable interface for users to download as a language package and used if
desired. Every binary offered as a download to users must be delivered with a
Docker image, a GitHub Action or similar integrations.</p><figure class="img-responsive float-left mr-5 mb-4"><a href=https://unsplash.com/@anniespratt target=_blank><img src=/images/blog/how-open-source-can-drive-product-obsession/how_open_source_can_drive_product_obsession_3.jpg></a><figcaption><p>Photo by Annie Spratt (Unsplash)</p></figcaption></figure><p>These are the opportunities to build user communities that interact directly
with the developers of your organization. These users will often end up filing
issues directly in GitHub rather than raising a ticket with customer support,
reducing both the drag on the support team and allowing the bug fixes to be
detected and fixed more quickly. Suddenly features aren’t thrown over a wall
anymore as engineers are exposed to direct user feedback. Additionally, shipping
open source features provides a path to developer content that can be easily
created with support of a marketing department, or as a conference or meetup
presentation given by the developer. This type of exposure naturally boosts the
connection between the developer, the product and the end user as well as between
employee and employer given that the developer now represents the company and
its mission in public.</p><p>Ultimately, encouraging the open sourcing of projects shifts the engineering
culture from being isolated from end users to representatives of their own
deliverables who understand the pain of their customers. Where a customer used
to file a support ticket via email, that eventually transforms into a bug ticket
and at some point is pulled into the sprint of an engineering team - such issues
now are directly reported in a true open source fashion by filling an issue
through GitHub. This drastically reduces the time between when a developer becomes
aware of the issue and helps them prioritize as they have a direct technical
understanding of it and its impact on user experience. With customer communication
now being bidirectional, a continuous feedback loop is enabled that allows the
creation of new ideas by the product team as well as by engineering. Such an
open relationship with the customer overall builds a product obsessed culture
that cultivates both innovation and great user experience.</p></div></div><div class=sharethis><p>Please share!</p><div class=sharethis-inline-share-buttons></div></div></div></div></section></div><footer class="bg-dark footer-section"><div class=section><div class=container><div class=row><div class=col-md-3><h5 class=text-white><strong>Links</strong></h5><p class=footer-item-text><a href=https://opensource.saucelabs.com/projects class=footer-item-text>Projects</a></p><p class=footer-item-text><a href=https://opensource.saucelabs.com/docs class=footer-item-text>Docs</a></p><p class=footer-item-text><a href=https://opensource.saucelabs.com/blog class=footer-item-text>Blog</a></p></div><div class=col-md-3><h5 class=text-white><strong>Organizations</strong></h5><p class=footer-item-text><a href=https://www.w3.org/ class=footer-item-text rel=noreferrer target=_blank>W3C</a></p><p class=footer-item-text><a href=https://www.linuxfoundation.org/ class=footer-item-text rel=noreferrer target=_blank>Linux Foundation</a></p><p class=footer-item-text><a href=https://openjsf.org/ class=footer-item-text rel=noreferrer target=_blank>OpenJS Foundation</a></p><p class=footer-item-text><a href=https://sfconservancy.org/ class=footer-item-text rel=noreferrer target=_blank>SFC</a></p><p class=footer-item-text><a href=https://todogroup.org/ class=footer-item-text rel=noreferrer target=_blank>TODO Group</a></p><p class=footer-item-text><a href=https://mobilenativefoundation.org/ class=footer-item-text rel=noreferrer target=_blank>Mobile Native Foundation</a></p></div><div class=col-md-3><h5 class=text-white><strong>Connect with us</strong></h5><p class=footer-item-text><a href=https://saucelabs.com/ class=footer-item-text target=_blank rel=noreferrer><i class="ti-world icon-footer"></i>Website</a></p><p class=footer-item-text><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/sauce-labs/ class=footer-item-text target=_blank rel=noreferrer><i class="ti-linkedin icon-footer"></i>Sauce Labs</a></p><p class=footer-item-text><a href=https://github.com/saucelabs class=footer-item-text target=_blank rel=noreferrer><i class="ti-github icon-footer"></i>@saucelabs</a></p><p class=footer-item-text><a href=https://twitter.com/saucelabs/ class=footer-item-text target=_blank rel=noreferrer><i class="ti-twitter-alt icon-footer"></i>@saucelabs</a></p><p class=footer-item-text><a href=mailto:opensource@saucelabs.com class=footer-item-text target=_blank rel=noreferrer><i class="ti-email icon-footer"></i>opensource@saucelabs.com</a></p></div></div><div class="row pt-5"><div class=col-md-12><small class="mb-0 text-white">© 2020 Sauce Labs Inc., all rights reserved.
