[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is an event that takes place every year for the entire month of October to encourage open source contributions. Here at Sauce Labs we produce and work on many open source projects. This page highlights opportunities and contributions to our projects during Hacktoberfest.
