Not long ago, we announced that we created our
[Open Source Program Office](https://saucelabs.com/news/sauce-labs-deepens-investment-in-oss-community-establishes-new-open-source-program-office)
to deepen our investment in the broader open source community. Open source is part of
our DNA here at Sauce, and this was a key part of our strategy to truly leverage
sustainable and active support for open source software (OSS) within the company.

Now, let’s take a closer look at the why, the what, and the how of the Open Source
Program Office.

First up, what’s our mission? The open source team at Sauce intends to actively
contribute to, develop, and lead open source projects that are critical to the
community and to the mission of Sauce Labs. Secondly, this team will adopt policies
that will enable Sauce employees to easily contribute to OSS projects by helping
them understand best practices of open source development.

And why do we believe so strongly in the value of open source? Simply put, we have
seen for ourselves that it allows us to harness the collective power of the global
testing and developer communities to develop and maintain the best, most useful
software. This benefits everyone—not just the developers, but also the users.

As a team, here’s what our Open Source Program Office is committed to doing:

- **Participate**: We invest and participate in projects and communities that share our
  common goal to create a world of digital confidence.
- **Share**: We are eager to share our knowledge, code, and practices around automated
  testing to benefit as many people as possible.
- **Promote**: We encourage and celebrate our engineering teams and the work they put
  out for the common good.

Christian Bromann and I helped establish the Open Source Program Office at Sauce Labs
because we personally believe so strongly in OSS. We are both software engineers with
years of experience leading and contributing to open source projects, including
Webdriver.io, Appium and Selenium. We are both committed to spreading the open source
love within Sauce Labs and the broader community.

Be sure to watch this space and stay tuned—in the coming months, we’ll be posting
about open source projects we work on, what we’re seeing across the community, and
how you can get involved.
