Participation in Open Source projects is highly encouraged, and the Open Source team wants to make this process as simple as possible. All Saucers are expected to follow common sense regarding what type of information and code is contributed to upstream Open Source projects. If you are in doubt, please reach out to the Open Source team or ask your manager for instructions.

### Summary

- Upstream contributions are highly encouraged
- Double-check you are not sharing confidential information
- Avoid contributions with information or code that gives us an advantage over competitors
- Only sign whitelisted CLAs, reach out to the Open Source team or Legal for advice

### Common Contribution Rules
- Do not share Sauce Labs confidential information
- Do not contribute code used internally that is giving us an advantage over competitors
    - In short, do not reveal our secret Sauce.
    - When in doubt, check with the Open Source team and your manager for guidelines on this
- Keep in mind that Sauce Labs has legal ownership of the contributions you do as you are a Sauce Labs employee, and CLAs are signed on behalf of Sauce Labs

### Non-code Contributions
Contributions to Open Source projects such as:

- Reporting issues
- Writing documentation
- Reviewing code
- Participating in project maintenance such as creating roadmaps, grooming backlogs, etc.

Are all activities which normally do not require to sign a CLA, are encouraged as part of your employment at Sauce Labs.

### Code Contributions
Upstream code contributions are encouraged to Open Source projects that our customers or our tech stack depend on. Code contributions can generally be divided into 2 categories:

- Contributions triggered by a work task: eg. a feature or a bug fix needs to be implemented in a project dependency and this is blocking your internal work at Sauce Labs
- Contributions on your own initiative

Both are allowed and they do not need a review unless you have questions about the contribution rules and guidelines mentioned above. Simply ensure that the project you are contributing to is not licensed under [AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).

### Whitelisted CLAs
If a non-Sauce Labs Open Source project requires you to sign a contributor agreement, ask the Open Source team or Legal, unless it is one of the following whitelisted CLAs:

- Selenium Project [CLA](https://gist.github.com/selenium-ci/90e5715f953d820cf3fc6f2c22f4184c#file-selenium_project_cla)
- Appium Project [CLA](https://cla.js.foundation/appium/appium)
