As a manager at Sauce Labs, you will from time to time be asked by your direct reports if they can make an internal codebase an open source project. This can be a difficult question to answer, so to guide your decision-making, we have put together a handy guide for you to review.

Also, every request to open source will be reviewed and must be approved by our Open Source Program Office (and usually in collaboration with Legal, Product, and so on). Feel free to reach out to the OSPO for advice beforehand, if you would like.

### Summary
To determine if a project can be open-sourced, you should be able to answer “yes“ to the following 3 questions, background information on each are provided in sections below:

__Value of ownership:__ Do the maintainers and Sauce Labs benefit from open sourcing this code?

__Commitment:__ Have you approved that the maintainers will have the time to work on the project and promote it beyond Sauce Labs?

__Confidentiality:__ Are you sure the source code does not expose any of Sauce Labs competitive advantages, and that the source code helps users, not just our competitors?

### Value of ownership
In short, does Sauce Labs benefit in any way from open-sourcing this code? There can be several direct or indirect ways Sauce Labs can benefit, as listed below:

- __Internal use:__ The code is used inside Sauce Labs and there is a vested interest in long term maintenance
- __Employer branding:__ Project gives an insight into the scale and problem-solving of Sauce Labs
- __Hiring:__ contributors and users of the project could be attractive job candidates
- __Learning:__ Saucers can collaborate with and learn from external experts on the topic
- __Enhancement:__ the project could gain new functionality and refinement by external use and contribution

Probably all the previous benefits will not apply to every single project under the Sauce Labs organization, but apply common sense and consider if the project is too specific for the Sauce Labs environment, if it is too generic or if it will not have a real user base outside Sauce Labs.

### Commitment
An Open Source project requires maintenance, and therefore time and resources, which can be seen as:

- __Allocated time:__ will the maintainers be granted work time to support the project - if so, how much?
- __Promotion:__ maintainers are asked to promote their project and talk about it publicly, for example at conferences and in blog posts - does this fit with their schedule?

### Confidentiality
It goes without saying that some components working inside Sauce Labs should not be released as an Open Source project, a few points that serve as guidelines are:

- __Secret Sauce:__ This project is vital and a differentiator for Sauce Labs, it could contain how test results are analyzed or how central parts of the platform are built.
- __Uses confidential data:__ the project processes or relies on customer or employee data which cannot be exposed
- __Only useful to competitors:__ the purpose of this project is not useful outside Sauce Labs, except for one or more competitors.

### Additional Guidance
If you need any guidance before approving an open-source project, please reach out to the Open Source team.

In addition, every single project that wants to be open-sourced will be reviewed by the Open Source team, who could raise any additional questions for you as a manager or to the maintainers.
