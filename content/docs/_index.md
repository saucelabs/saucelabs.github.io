##### Saucers have used Open Source since Day One, but there are still misconceptions and uncertainties on how to engage in Open Source. Questions on legal issues, licensing and what is deemed confidential or internal information is common.

##### These documents are a principally guide for Saucers - but also serve as a reference by anyone else - on how to adopt, modify and release Open Source code.

> This content is inspired by Zalando's Open Source [documentation](https://opensource.zalando.com/docs), which has an [MIT license](https://github.com/zalando/zalando.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE) as well as various of other sources. However, many of the things we do are unique to how Sauce Labs operates and our engineering culture, so these should not be read as "how-to" guides. To hear from more companies deeply involved in open source, we recommend checking out the [TODO Group](https://todogroup.org/).

### Topics

- [Approval guide for managers]({{< relref "approval-guide.md" >}}) As a manager at Sauce Labs, you will from time to time be asked by your direct reports if they can make an internal codebase an open source project.
- [Contributing to Open Source]({{< relref "contributing.md" >}}) Participation in Open Source projects is highly encouraged, and the Open Source team wants to make this process as simple as possible.
- [Open Source Licensing Guide]({{< relref "license-guide.md" >}}) Policies and guidance on which licenses can be used at Sauce Labs, both internally and in open source projects hosted under a Sauce Labs managed GitHub organization.
- [Releasing a new Open Source project]({{< relref "releasing.md" >}}) Here you can see all the steps that describe how Saucers can release a new Open Source project.

If any of the docs are unclear, misleading or wrong, please reach out to the [Open Source team](mailto:opensource@saucelabs.com) at Sauce Labs.
