description: "Sauce Labs Open Source Documentation with guidelines for Open Source best practices and policies."

##### Saucers have been using and contributing to open source projects since the company started. Regardless, there was no guidance on how to engage in open source. This is an initiative to clarify questions about legal issues, licensing and what is confidential or proprietary information

##### The following documents are primarily intended for Saucers - but will also serve as a reference by anyone else - on how to adopt, modify and release open source code

> This content is mostly inspired by Zalando’s Open Source [documentation](https://opensource.zalando.com/docs). Please consider this as a guideline instead of a how-to, as Sauce Labs operates in a unique way and we have our own engineering culture. To understand more about companies deeply involved in open source, we recommend checking out the [TODO Group](https://todogroup.org/).

### Topics

- [Approval guide for managers]({{< relref "approval-guide.md" >}}) As a manager at Sauce Labs, you will from time to time be asked by your direct reports if they can make an internal codebase an open source project.
- [Contributing to Open Source]({{< relref "contributing.md" >}}) Participation in open source projects is highly encouraged, and the Open Source Program Office (OSPO) wants to make this process as simple as possible.
- [Open Source Licensing Guide]({{< relref "license-guide.md" >}}) Policies and guidance on which licenses can be used at Sauce Labs, both internally and in open source projects hosted under a Sauce Labs managed GitHub organization.
- [Releasing a new Open Source project]({{< relref "releasing.md" >}}) Here you can see all the steps that describe how Saucers can release a new open source project.
